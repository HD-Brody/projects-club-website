Backend Flask app (starter)

- Create a Python virtual environment inside `backend/` (not checked into git): `python -m venv venv`
- Activate it and install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Configure environment variables in the top-level `.env` or your shell.
- Run: `python run.py`

API will be available at http://localhost:5000 and CORS is configured to allow the Vite frontend at http://localhost:5173.
